Plugin updates

Notes on japicmp usage in 46
----------------------------
For japicmp to work when running 'mvn site', we must first run package
because japicmp needs a built artifact to which to compare the previous
version. Thus, we run 'mvn package site' to get an appropriate japicmp
report. Further, during project build we see the following warning and
stacktrace during site generation:

[debug] No packaging support defined, no filtering
[info] Skipping execution because packaging of this module is 'pom'.
[debug] Searching for versions in versionRange: (,46)
[info] Unable to find a previous version of the project in the repository.
[warn] No new version specified and file '/..../commons-parent/pom.xml' of artifact could not be opened as jar archive: error in opening zip file

java.util.zip.ZipException: error in opening zip file

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o Add java-1.10 profile
o Add java-1.11 profile


Changes:
o japicmp-maven-plugin 0.11.0 -> 0.11.1
o maven-surefire-report-plugin 2.20.1 -> 2.21.0
o jacoco-maven-plugin 0.8.0 -> 0.8.1

Removed:
o Prerequisites tag; should only be used for maven-plugins, using maven-enforcer-plugin instead.

Notes on Building version 44.
-----------------------------
When building, because of an issue with japicmp, we have an erroneous non-failing stacktrace
that occurs. Specifically, we see:

[warn] No new version specified and file './commons-parent/pom.xml' of artifact could not be opened as
      jar archive: error in opening zip file
java.util.zip.ZipException: error in opening zip file

mainly caused by an error in
japicmp.maven.JApiCmpMojo.populateArchivesListsFromParameters(JApiCmpMojo.java:341).

We have asked for this to be addressed in the github issue: https://github.com/siom79/japicmp/issues/195

o maven-enforcer-plugin set version to 3.0.0-M1 and update Maven requirement from 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 (the latest 3.0.x.)
